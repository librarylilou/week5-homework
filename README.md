# Your Work Day Scheduler

The work day scheduler is an excellent tool to use for planning tasks one would like to accomplish a day on the job, from 9 am to 5 pm. The user has the ability to input a task for each hour block. 

Moreover the schedule time coordinates with a color. Such that, if it is the present time the row turns green. With that, the user may always stay aware of where they are in the schedule and continue to be time efficient with their to-do's of the work day.

## Motivation ⭐
As a programmer, the motive behind the development of this application was to learn how to read documents efficiently for the installation of new tools, such as Luxon a date/time library. In addition,  further exploring the utility of JavaScript when it comes to the functionality of an application and its local storage.

## Installation ⭐
Since this application was delivered with some starter code of the heading of the work day schedule, I decided to get the date and time function first before anything else. Which is when I started my research on Luxon and how to get this alternative library functioning. After much trial and error I was able to get it to work with some guidance from a Youtube video on luxon. 

Once, I was able to get the current time displayed on the schedule I moved on to listing the hours on the HTML page from 9 am to 5 pm. The user then was able to input a task in the text box.

For the future, I will learn how to set the current time block where it lights up green, indicating it's the current time. I will also focus on establishing some local storage so the user may save the notes they make on the schedule. With these future attributes the work day schedule may be put to good use.
